# Pasteit!
A simple pastebin site. 
It features a simple UI, with easy creation and deletion of pastes.
The pastes have been classified into public and private. Public pastes are viewed by everyone, and private only the user(the author).
Moreover the created pastes can be toggled to private or public as per user requirement.
After the creation of each paste a unique URL is generated. The URL can be used to view public pastes. If the user is logged in the private pastes can also be viewed using the URL.

Setup:
1. Clone the repo(in local machine or virtual machine).
2. Set up the database with the schema.sql in the schema directory.
3. Replace the dummyuser, dummyhost and dummypass with username, hostname and password of the database in the config.php file
4. Set up the server.
5. Enjoy pasting!
